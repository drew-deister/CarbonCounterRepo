Date: 12/14/19\
Branch Author: Ethan Shifrin\
Branch Purpose: A basic navigation of home screen with a Carbon Counter button has been created.\
In order to get a handle on our power and capabilities with react native, this branch is my attempt to build question components for the housing page of the Carbon Counter Survey\
\
Documentation for every document should look like the following\
// Question.js\
// Author: Ethan Shifrin\
// Email: Ethan.Shifrin@Vanderbilt.edu\
// Date: 12/19/19\
// parent files: This question component is built with the housing survey in mind (../Surveys/Housing.js)\
// purpose: Display a single question and text input on a Carbon Counter survey screen.\
//          For now, it is just used in the Housing component, but hopefully will be extended to other categories\
//          note: author had difficulty implementing state, therefore state is not yet used\
// To Do:\
//    1. Implement state to keep track of user input\
